\\r\\n> *\u201cYou can\u2019t store large files onchain\u2014it\u2019s too expensive.\u201d*  \\r\\n\\r\\nWTTP proves that wrong with **chunking**, a simple but powerful idea.\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* truncate */}\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde9 What is Chunking?\\r\\nInstead of trying to cram an entire file into a single transaction, WTTP **splits files into smaller pieces** called chunks.  \\r\\n\\r\\n- Each chunk is about 16KB.  \\r\\n- Chunks are stored as **DataPoints** with unique addresses.  \\r\\n- Together, they reassemble into your original file.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udca1 Why It Matters\\r\\n- **Cost Efficiency**: Storing 100 small pieces is cheaper (and safer) than one massive blob.  \\r\\n- **Reliability**: If one chunk fails, you don\u2019t lose the entire file.  \\r\\n- **Scalability**: Big assets like images, documents, even apps can live fully onchain.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd0d Example\\r\\nWhen you upload a 1MB image to WTTP:  \\r\\n- The file is split into ~64 chunks.  \\r\\n- Each chunk gets its own address.  \\r\\n- WTTP automatically reassembles them when someone requests the file.  \\r\\n\\r\\nTo the user, it

**Web3 Transfer Protocol (WTTP)**, the instinct is to ask:  \\r\\n> *\u201cIsn\u2019t this just blockchain jargon for something we already have?\u201d*  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe answer: no. It\u2019s a re-imagining of the web\u2019s plumbing\u2014familiar enough to use, but designed for permanence and fairness.  \\r\\nLet\u2019s break it down in **plain English**.\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* truncate */}\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd27 WTTP = HTTP + Blockchain\\r\\nThe web you use every day runs on **HTTP**. It\u2019s the protocol behind every `https://` link you\u2019ve ever clicked.  \\r\\nWTTP is its decentralized cousin.\\r\\n\\r\\n- `GET`: still retrieves content.  \\r\\n- `PUT`: still uploads content.  \\r\\n- `PATCH`: still updates content.  \\r\\n- But now these calls happen **onchain**.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat means:\\r\\n- Nobody can silently delete or change your files.  \\r\\n- Your resources live as permanent records.  \\r\\n- The network, not a company, keeps them alive.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udca1 The Big Differences\\r\\n1. **Content addressing**  \\r\\n   Every piece of content has a unique fingerprint. If two people upload the same file, it only gets stored once.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Built-in royalties**  \\r\\n   If someone reuses your content, WTTP pays you automatically. The system itself tracks who created what.  \\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Permissions you define**  \\r\\n   Want to make part of your site open, another part editable by collaborators? WTTP\u2019s role system makes that possible.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\uddea A Quick Example\\r\\nPublishing your first WTTP resource is as simple as:  \\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nimport { WTTPHandler } from \'wttp-handler\';\\r\\n\\r\\nconst handler = new WTTPHandler();\\r\\nawait handler.fetch(\'wttp://mysite.bio\', {\\r\\n  method: \'PUT\',\\r\\n  headers: { \'Content-Type\': \'text/plain\' },\\r\\n  body: \'Hello, permanent web!\'\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that text isn\u2019t tied to a server.

Value flows *away* from the creator.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udcb0 WTTP\u2019s Solution\\r\\nEvery piece of content in WTTP is stored as a **DataPoint**.  \\r\\nWhen someone reuses your DataPoint:  \\r\\n\\r\\n1. They pay a small royalty.  \\r\\n2. **90%** goes to you, the creator.  \\r\\n3. **10%** supports the network.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis happens **automatically**. No middlemen, no lawsuits, no ad networks.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd11 Why This Works\\r\\n- **Fairness baked in**: the system itself enforces royalties.  \\r\\n- **Global reach**: your DataPoint works across all WTTP sites and networks.  \\r\\n- **Incentives aligned**: creators are rewarded for making things worth reusing.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83e\udde9 A Simple Example\\r\\nLet\u2019s say you upload an image to WTTP.  \\r\\n- A blogger uses it in their article.  \\r\\n- A developer reuses it in an app.  \\r\\n- A designer builds on it in their portfolio.  \\r\\n\\r\\nEach reuse triggers a royalty payment back to you. The more your work travels, the more you earn.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n<Callout type=\\"info\\">\\r\\nThink of it as **Web3\u2019s answer to Creative Commons**: you decide what to share, and if it\u2019s reused, the network pays you fairly.\\r\\n</Callout>\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Why It Matters\\r\\nRoyalties change the economics of the web.  \\r\\nInstead of \u201cwinner-takes-all\u201d platforms, we get a **commons where creators are valued**.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\u2019s what DIP is about.  \\r\\nThat\u2019s why WTTP matters."},{"id":"hello-world-on-wttp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/hello-world-on-wttp","editUrl":"https://github.com/TechnicallyWeb3/dip-docs/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-12-01-hello-world-on-wttp.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-01-hello-world-on-wttp.mdx","title":"Hello World on WTTP","description":"Every new technology needs a \u201cHello World\u201d moment.","date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"WTTP","permalink":"/blog/tags/wttp","description":"Web3 Transfer Protocol"},{"inline":false,"label":"Developer","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/developer"},{"inline":false,"label":"Tutorial","permalink":"/blog/tags/blog/tags/tutorial"},{"inline":false,"label":"DIP","permalink":"/blog/tags/dip","description":"Decentralized Internet Project"}],"readingTime":0.65,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"DIP Team","title":"Decentralized Internet Project","url":"https://github.com/TechnicallyWeb3","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/dip-team"},"socials":{"github":"https://github.com/TechnicallyWeb3","x":"https://x.com/TechnicallyWeb3"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/TechnicallyWeb3.png","key":"dip-team"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"hello-world-on-wttp","title":"Hello World on WTTP","authors":["dip-team"],"tags":["wttp","developer","tutorial","dip"],"date":"2024-12-01T00:00:00.000Z"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Royalties Built Into the Web","permalink":"/blog/royalties-on-the-web"},"nextItem":{"title":"A New Web, Built Together","permalink":"/blog/welcome-2025"}},"content":"Every new technology needs a **\u201cHello World\u201d** moment.  \\r\\nHere\u2019s how to publish your first WTTP resource in under 10 lines of code.\\r\\n\\r\\n{/* truncate */}\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udee0 Prerequisites\\r\\n- Node.js installed  \\r\\n- A funded wallet (on testnet is fine)  \\r\\n- The `wttp-handler` library  \\r\\n\\r\\n```bash\\r\\nnpm install wttp-handler\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## \ud83d\udd8a Write Your First Resource\\r\\n```js\\r\\nimport { WTTPHandler } from \'wttp-handler\';\\r\\n\\r\\nconst handler = new WTTPHandler();\\r\\n\\r\\nawait handler.fetch(\'wttp://my-first-site/index.html\', {\\r\\n  method: \'PUT\',\\r\\n  headers: { \\r\\n    \'Content-Type\': \'text/html\',\\r\\n    \'Content-Location\': \'/index.html\'\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  body: \'<h1>Hello WTTP!</h1>\'\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThat\u2019s it.
