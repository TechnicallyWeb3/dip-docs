When people first hear about the **Web3 Transfer Protocol (WTTP)**, the instinct is to ask:  
> *“Isn’t this just blockchain jargon for something we already have?”*  

The answer: no. It’s a re-imagining of the web’s plumbing—familiar enough to use, but designed for permanence and fairness.  
Let’s break it down in **plain English**.

## 🔧 WTTP = HTTP + Blockchain
The web you use every day runs on **HTTP**. It’s the protocol behind every `https://` link you’ve ever clicked.  
WTTP is its decentralized cousin.

- `GET`: still retrieves content.  
- `PUT`: still uploads content.  
- `PATCH`: still updates content.  
- But now these calls happen **onchain**.  

That means:
- Nobody can silently delete or change your files.  
- Your resources live as permanent records.  
- The network, not a company, keeps them alive.

## 💡 The Big Differences
1. **Content addressing**  
   Every piece of content has a unique fingerprint. If two people upload the same file, it only gets stored once.  

2. **Built-in royalties**  
   If someone reuses your content, WTTP pays you automatically. The system itself tracks who created what.  

3. **Permissions you define**  
   Want to make part of your site open, another part editable by collaborators? WTTP’s role system makes that possible.

## 🧪 A Quick Example
Publishing your first WTTP resource is as simple as:  

```js
import { WTTPHandler } from 'wttp-handler';

const handler = new WTTPHandler();
await handler.fetch('wttp://mysite.bio', {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' },
  body: 'Hello, permanent web!'
});
```

Now that text isn’t tied to a server. It’s part of the blockchain web.

WTTP isn’t about replacing the internet you know — it’s about giving it a memory, fairness, and resilience.
