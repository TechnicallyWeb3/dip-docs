One of the biggest misconceptions about blockchain is:  
> *“You can’t store large files onchain—it’s too expensive.”*  

WTTP proves that wrong with **chunking**, a simple but powerful idea.

## 🧩 What is Chunking?
Instead of trying to cram an entire file into a single transaction, WTTP **splits files into smaller pieces** called chunks.  

- Each chunk is about 16KB.  
- Chunks are stored as **DataPoints** with unique addresses.  
- Together, they reassemble into your original file.  

---

## 💡 Why It Matters
- **Cost Efficiency**: Storing 100 small pieces is cheaper (and safer) than one massive blob.  
- **Reliability**: If one chunk fails, you don’t lose the entire file.  
- **Scalability**: Big assets like images, documents, even apps can live fully onchain.

## 🔍 Example
When you upload a 1MB image to WTTP:  
- The file is split into ~64 chunks.  
- Each chunk gets its own address.  
- WTTP automatically reassembles them when someone requests the file.  

To the user, it feels like downloading a normal file—  
but under the hood, it’s a symphony of chunks.

Chunking turns blockchain storage from “impractical” to **unstoppable**.  
The bigger the web gets, the more this matters.
