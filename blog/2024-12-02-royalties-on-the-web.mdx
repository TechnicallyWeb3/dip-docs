For most of the web’s history, creators got the short end of the stick.  
Your content is copied, reshared, monetized — and you might never see a cent.  

The **Decentralized Internet Project (DIP)** is changing that with WTTP.  
Here’s how **royalties become part of the web itself**.

## 🎨 The Problem Today
- **Artists** upload to platforms that take most of the revenue.  
- **Developers** share open-source code that powers million-dollar apps, without reward.  
- **Writers** publish posts that others rehost, remix, or monetize.  

The common thread? Value flows *away* from the creator.

## 💰 WTTP’s Solution
Every piece of content in WTTP is stored as a **DataPoint**.  
When someone reuses your DataPoint:  

1. They pay a small royalty.  
2. **90%** goes to you, the creator.  
3. **10%** supports the network.  

This happens **automatically**. No middlemen, no lawsuits, no ad networks.

## 🔑 Why This Works
- **Fairness baked in**: the system itself enforces royalties.  
- **Global reach**: your DataPoint works across all WTTP sites and networks.  
- **Incentives aligned**: creators are rewarded for making things worth reusing.

## 🧩 A Simple Example
Let’s say you upload an image to WTTP.  
- A blogger uses it in their article.  
- A developer reuses it in an app.  
- A designer builds on it in their portfolio.  

Each reuse triggers a royalty payment back to you. The more your work travels, the more you earn.

Think of it as **Web3’s answer to Creative Commons**: you decide what to share, and if it’s reused, the network pays you fairly.

## 🚀 Why It Matters
Royalties change the economics of the web.  
Instead of “winner-takes-all” platforms, we get a **commons where creators are valued**.  

That’s what DIP is about.  
That’s why WTTP matters.
