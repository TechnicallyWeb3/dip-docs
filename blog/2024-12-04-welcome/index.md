We started the **Decentralized Internet Project (DIP)** because the web has forgotten something important:  
it was meant to belong to *all of us*.  

Today, most of the web lives on platforms that can vanish, change their terms, or shut you out with a single click.  
With **WTTP (Web3 Transfer Protocol)**, we’re putting publishing power back in your hands—  
so your site, your words, your work stay *yours*, permanently.

## 🌍 What we’re building
- **WTTP**: a decentralized protocol to publish websites to the blockchain and keep them online for good.  
- **DataPoint Registry**: content addressing + built-in royalties, so creators are rewarded when their work is reused.  
- **Custom Sites**: tools that let you build, test, and deploy decentralized sites with the same ease as uploading a file.  

Think of it as HTTP reinvented for Web3—familiar methods like `GET` and `PUT`, but with immutability, ownership, and creator incentives baked in.

## ✨ Why it matters
If you’ve ever:
- clicked a link only to find it broken,  
- seen your work reshared without credit,  
- or wondered why your digital identity depends on a company’s server staying online…  

then you already understand the need.  
WTTP makes links durable, gives credit where it’s due, and cuts out the single points of failure.

## 🚀 How to get started
Pick one small thing that matters to you:
- your personal bio,  
- a project README,  
- a manifesto,  

…and publish it on WTTP. Share the link. Notice how it feels when *you* control the endpoint—not a platform.

You don’t need to rebuild the whole web overnight. Start small. Permanence grows one resource at a time.

## 🤝 The road ahead
This blog won’t be a whitepaper dump. Expect:
- Creator and developer spotlights  
- Notes on what works (and what still doesn’t)  
- Honest updates as we push DIP and WTTP forward  

The web’s future will be more collaborative, resilient, and worth keeping—  
**if we build it together.**

Welcome to the next chapter of the internet.
