The web doesn’t stop at one server.  
So why should the decentralized web stop at one chain?  

WTTP was designed for **multi-network support** from day one.

## 🌐 What Multi-Network Means
WTTP sites can be deployed on:  
- Ethereum  
- Polygon  
- Base  
- Arbitrum  
- Fantom  
- Avalanche  
…and more.  

Each network is just another home for your site.

## ⚡ Benefits
1. **Resilience**  
   If one chain slows down, your site still lives elsewhere.  

2. **Choice**  
   Developers can pick the network that best fits their needs (fees, speed, community).  

3. **Interoperability**  
   A WTTP link doesn’t care which chain it’s on—the protocol handles the rest.

## 🔧 Under the Hood
- The **ProviderManager** handles network switching.  
- The **ContractManager** keeps track of addresses across chains.  
- Your `wttp.config.json` file is the map that ties it all together.

The web was always bigger than one machine.  
Now it’s bigger than one blockchain.
