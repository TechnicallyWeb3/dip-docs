# Browser Overview

The WTTP Browser is a specialized fork of the [Min Browser](https://minbrowser.org/) that has been enhanced with Web3 Transfer Protocol (WTTP) support, enabling direct access to decentralized websites and applications hosted on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains.

## About Min Browser

This browser is built upon the excellent foundation of [Min Browser](https://github.com/minbrowser/min) by [PalmerAL](https://github.com/PalmerAL). Min is a fast, minimal browser that protects your privacy and includes features such as:

- Full-text search for visited pages
- Ad and tracker blocking
- Automatic reader view
- Tasks (tab groups)
- Bookmark tagging
- Password manager integration
- Dark theme

We extend our sincere gratitude to the Min Browser team for creating such a robust and privacy-focused browser that serves as the perfect foundation for Web3 integration.

## WTTP Integration

- **Access Decentralized Websites**: Browse websites hosted directly on smart contracts
- **ENS Domain Resolution**: Navigate using human-readable Ethereum Name Service domains
- **Contract Address Access**: Direct access to websites using contract addresses
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Access content across multiple EVM-compatible networks
- **Seamless Web3 Experience**: No additional extensions or plugins required

## Key Features
